    Check out this video for a demo of how to use this: (I'll put a video here eventually)
    
    Instructions:
    
    1) Create a V1 EDL: 
        - Flatten your sequence, moving every visible clip down to V1
        - Export this as an EDL, make sure your Tape names are in the event line like so:

                        000008  **A540C008_241009QL**

    2) Create your ALE
        - Drag your V1 sequence into a new bin.
        - Right Click > Set Bin Display... > And select only **"Master Clips"** and **"Show reference clips"**
        - Set your bin view to **only** have the following columns:
        
                        Name    Tracks    Tape    Start    End    Source File
        - Export this ALE to your desktop


    3) Upload & Download
        - Drag and drop into the boxes above, download your shiny new EDL
        


    4) Reimport
        - Use the source browser to reimport this sequence back into Media Composer
        - When Prompted, select **"Don't Map"** under the "Select Audio Mapping" drop down, and continue the import
        - You may get some error messages is respeeds were present, but you can ignore those
        - You should now have a massive timeline of offline audio media, nice!


        
    5) Relink
        - Right click your sequence -> Relink -> Managed Media
        - This step will probably vary and take some tinkering, but generally I use these settings:
            - Select the drive where your media lives
            - Utilize "Tape Name or Source File Name"
            - Tick "Ignore Extension"
            - Untick "Match case when..."
            - Select only "Audio" under "Tracks to relink"
            - Untick "Create New Sequence" if you like
        - Click ok and hope for the best
        - If you've got recaps pulling from other eps, you may need to go episode by episode to get those guys back online



    6) Check
        - Cut back in your original V1 EDL to a video track in your newly relinked sequence and make sure things look good



    7) Export
        - Send that baby out!
